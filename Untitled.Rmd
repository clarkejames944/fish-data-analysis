Hello,

After some preliminary analysis of the Tiger Flathead otolith dataset I have one question to ask in regards to the 'AdjAge' variable within the dataset.

From what I understand 'AdjAge' is a measure of the overall age of the fish when caught (as stated in Federico's original explanatory notes, as shown below).





``````{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Federico's original notes on AdjAge", out.width = '75%'}
knitr::include_graphics("AdjAge.png")
```





From this statement I expect only deviations of 1 between the final 'Age' value and the 'AdjAge'. However, as shown in the original dataset below, for older individuals these values 
do no show this pattern. As seen from the dataset, a value of 28 for AdjAge is applied to an individual which only has counts to 15 years of age when caught. I understand that this value of 28 is the difference between the age at capture (yearcap) and the year of birth (YearClass). However, I previously presumed that the age (and therefore year of birth) would be inferred through increment counts. But given this example were only 15 increments were measured it may through other means or perhaps that 28 increments were present but only 15 were measured for some reason. This is common for older individuals within the dataset and I was hoping you could elucidate me in respect to this.



``````{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="The datasheet-highlighted cells indicate the query", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("AdjAge-datasheet.png")
```




Furthermore the Australian government's fishery page (https://www.afma.gov.au/fisheries-management/species/tiger-flathead) states that the Tiger Flathead typically only lives up to 15 years old.

I am just wondering where these values for 'AdjAge' for older individuals come from
